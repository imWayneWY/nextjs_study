My server is very slow and is locating in China, and this is a SSR(Server Side Render) app. So it is slow to visit. Sorry about that.
This demo can use Github OAuth to login and session. Can search and check issues for repos. It's a practice for studying Next.js. I learned a lot like the difference of using of redux between regular and SSR. And the ctx using in Next.js. I think umi.js has some similar function like Next.js.


Sorry for doesn't have domain. Chinese server need to be supervised to host domains.

**Techniques: Next.js, Koa2, Ant-Design, Redis, OAuth2.0**
